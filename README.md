# Awesome Free Software [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated list of free software.

What is free software? "Free" as in cost? Open source? Not quite. In order for a piece of software to be truly free, its license must allow users to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software without imposing excessive restrictions.

The Free Software Foundation defines [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) as software that gives you:

- the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- the freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 
- the freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
- the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from the changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

Feel free to submit a pull request. The only requirements are that the software must strictly adhere to the above definition, and you must have used it enough to know that it is [awseome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md).
