# Awesome Free Software [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated list of free software.

What is free software? "Free" as in cost? Open source? Not quite. In order for a piece of software to be truly free, its license must allow users to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software without imposing excessive restrictions.

The Free Software Foundation defines [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) as software that gives you:

- the freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- the freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 
- the freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
- the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from the changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

Free software can be licensed in a number of ways. The [GNU GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) encourages propagation of free software, but free software can also be [unlicensed](http://unlicense.org/). Read more about the licenses [here](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/). Most of the software below should have one of the licenses listed in the [appendix](http://choosealicense.com/appendix/).

In other words, software that falls under any of the three boxes on the left is good for this list. Software from the right two boxes is not.

Feel free to submit a pull request. The software that you add must strictly adhere to the above definition, and you must have used it enough to know that it is [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md). See [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/johnjago/Awesome-Free-Software/blob/master/contributing.md) for more information.
